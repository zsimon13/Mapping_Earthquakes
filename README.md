# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose
This project's purpose was to use mapping tools from mapbox and leaflet in order to creat dynamic/interactive maps of earthquakes. Tile layers and data layers were used to create the tectonic plates, and major earthquake layers. Multiple map styles were implemented. 

## Software Used
javaScript was used for the scripting and pulling of JSON data. API calls were made to the Mapbox website to pull data, and the web app was designed using HTML and CSS.
